            Most of the classical dance forms originated in temples. Worshipping was the main aim. 
            Although every dance form evolved from different regions, their roots are the same. 
            The roots can be traced from the Sanskrit text – ‘Natya Shastra’. The first compilation 
            of Natya Shastra is dated between 200BCE and 200CE. As time passed, artists improvised 
            many classical dances which resulted in the present day forms. Today, Indian classical 
            dances are very popular dance all over the world.

          Hip hop dance is a range of street dance styles primarily performed to hip hop music or that have evolved as part of hip hop culture. It is influenced by a wide range of styles that were created in the 1970s and made popular by dance crews in the United States. The television show Soul Train and the 1980s films Breakin', Beat Street, and Wild Style showcased these crews and dance styles in their early stages; therefore, giving hip-hop dance mainstream exposure. The dance industry responded with a commercial, studio-based version of hip-hop—sometimes called "new style"—and a hip-hop influenced style of jazz dance called "jazz-funk".

          Salsa<span>Dance</span>
          </h2>

          <p class="dance-text">
Salsa dancing evolved as a dance to accompany salsa music which was popularized in the 1960s. Originally a street dance, salsa dance steps came to be more formalized once schools began opening up teaching students how to dance salsa with a set curriculum. One of the early influential instructors in salsa was Eddie Torres, who helped to formalize the timing for New York-style salsa, and popularized the style around the world.
There is some debate surrounding the exact origins of the name "salsa". Some claim that it originated from something musicians shouted while they were playing their music to generate excitement.The term was popularized by the record label Fania Records to better market their music, and Fania founder Johnny Pacheco says he chose the word "salsa" because of its spicy and hot connotations.Whatever its origin, the term is fitting because salsa dancing and music is a mixture of different styles, just like salsa or "sauce" in Latin American countries is a mixture of different ingredients.

Belly Dance</span>
          </h2>

          <p class="dance-text">
The term "belly dance" is a westernized name that originally referred to traditional Middle Eastern dancing. The earliest forms of belly dance were the Egyptian ghawazi dance during the 19th century, and Raqs Sharqi, an Arabic dance of the 20th century. Despite Egypt's location in Africa and contributions from other nations such as France, Turkey and the United States, the term belly dance is usually used today to include all traditional dances of the Middle Eastern region, including those not geographically situated there.
Belly dancing gained popularity in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s during a time when more women were becoming free spirits. By this time, the dance had quite a sensual reputation, and western women worked hard to reinvent it as a woman-focused dance that was performed in conjunction with female celebrations such as childbirth and new-age Goddess worship.
